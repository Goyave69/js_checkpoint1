# Checkpoint 1 - JS

Your 1st checkpoint !

**!!! FIRST MANDATORY STEP, TO DO BEFORE YOU READ ANY FURTHER !!!**

---

- Clone this project
- Create a branch named `lastname_firstname` (lower case, snake case), which will hold you work... _Of course, please replace "lastname" and "firstname" with your personal information ;-)_

---

**Every time you finish one of the exercises:**

- Create a commit with an EXPLICIT message on your branch
- Push your work on GitHub

## Step 1 - Quizz

- Visit [this app](https://wild-quiz-client.herokuapp.com/)
- Take the "Checkpoint 1 - JS (EN)" quizz and answer the questions
- Once you're done, copy the link provided by the app
- Create a `quizz.md` at the project root
- Paste the aformentionned link in it
- Commit this file

## Step 2 - JS algorithms

Resolve these three exercises:

Unit tests are available. They will let you know if your algorithms are working correctly!

First, install the dependencies (with `npm install` :wink:)".
Then, you can run them :

```sh
npm test # this command runs all tests

npm run test:1 # this command executes tests for the first algorithm only
npm run test:2 # this command executes tests for the second algorithm only
# etc... for every algorithms.

```

> [algo1.js](./algo/1/thirdAngle.js)
>
> [algo2.js](./algo/2/isLeapYear.js)
>
> [algo3.js](./algo/3/theaterSieges.js)

If you have more time, you **can** work on these (optionnal):

> [algo4.js](./algo/4/findAdults.js)
>
> [algo5.js](./algo/5/getPoints.js)
>
> [algo6.js](./algo/6/sumArr.js)

## Step 3 - Portfolio

_Nota bene: in this test, you **mustn't** use Bootstrap, use flexboxes in it's stead !_
