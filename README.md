# Checkpoint 1 - JS

## Introduction - What are Checkpoints?

This is your first checkpoint, a **checkpoint** is a term used in Wild Code School WCS to describe a **timed self assessment**, usually lasting for half a day (up to a full day or more).

These checkpoints are designed to achieve a number of objectives by presenting the learner with:
> 1. ... a way to measure their progress 📏📈
> 2. ... the abilty to integrate the skills acquired towards a meaningful end 🚩🥅
> 3. ... the opportunity to exercise the skill of time management and prioritization ⌛⬆️
> 3. ... the opportunity to review and learn from the code of others, showing that there are always many different ways to accomplish a task 👥💬

## Major Guidelines - Applicable to all Checkpoints

Every checkpoint involves a similar set of steps:
1. Clone the repo locally using git commands
2. Immediately after cloning, create a new branch locally and switch to it
3. To name your branch, we would like you to use the template `{{firstname}}_{{lastname}}` where:
  - `{{firstname}}` is a placeholder that must be replaced with your first (non-family) name, all in small caps (please do not use non-latin characters)
  - `{{lastname}}` is a placeholder that must be replaced with your last (family) name, all in small caps (please do not use non-latin characters)
4. Open the cloned repo in Visual Studio Code
5. Follow the instructions of the Checkpoint (usually in the README file in the Checkpoint's repo, like this one)
6. Commit after each step, with a commit message that highlights the part finished (e.g. `finish algo1 in part 1` or `finish step 3 of the CSS part in part 2`)
7. Push your changes to GitHub, preferably after each commit

# Instructions for this Checkpoint 

## Step 1 - JS algorithms (~2 hours)

Resolve these three exercises:

Unit tests are available. They will let you know if your algorithms are working correctly!

First, install the dependencies (with `npm install` :wink:)".
Then, you can run them :

```sh
npm test # this command runs all tests

npm run test:1 # this command executes tests for the first algorithm only
npm run test:2 # this command executes tests for the second algorithm only
# etc... for every algorithms.

```

> [algo1.js](./algo/1/thirdAngle.js)
>
> [algo2.js](./algo/2/isLeapYear.js)
>
> [algo3.js](algo/3/findAdults.js)

If you have more time, you can work on these (these are optional, **please skip in the first pass and come back to them when you are done with part 2 of the checkpoint)**:

> [algo4.js](algo/4/theaterSieges.js)
>
> [algo5.js](./algo/5/getPoints.js)
>
> [algo6.js](./algo/6/sumArr.js)

## Step 2 - Portfolio (~3 hours)

_Note: The instructions for this part of the checkpoint are in a separate file. Namely, you must double-click on the file named `home.html` inside of the directory named `site` inside of the repo (after cloning it on your computer) to open the instructions for this part of the checkpoint._

Follow the instructions in [this file](./site/home.html) (located in the `home.html` file inside of the `site` directory in the repo).

> Note, these instructions will guide you into how to change the file named `portfolio.html` in the same directory.
